# TelgramHub Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Miniapp-First Architecture
Every feature starts as a Telegram miniapp component; Miniapps must be self-contained, independently deployable, documented; Clear user value required - no technical-only components.

### II. API-First Interface
Every component exposes functionality via Telegram Bot API and REST APIs; Structured data protocol: JSON in/out with standardized schemas; Support both bot commands and miniapp interactions.

### III. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD mandatory: Tests written → User approved → Tests fail → Then implement; Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced; Mock Telegram API for all testing.

### IV. Real-Time Data Integration
Focus areas requiring real-time capabilities: Channel popularity tracking, Keyword-based notifications, User subscription management, Automated content discovery.

### V. User Privacy & Safety
All channel data must be publicly accessible only; User subscriptions private by default; Automatic content filtering for inappropriate channels; GDPR compliance for user data.

## Telegram Integration Standards

### Bot Development
All bot interactions must be contextual and helpful; Support for natural language commands; Inline search capabilities for channel discovery; Subscription management via bot commands.

### Miniapp Requirements
Responsive design for all Telegram screen sizes; Fast loading (<2 seconds) for channel discovery; Offline capability for saved channels; Progressive web app features.

### Data Collection Ethics
Only collect publicly available channel information; Respect Telegram's rate limits and terms of service; No automated joining or mass messaging; Transparent data usage policies.

## Development Standards

### Technology Stack
JavaScript/TypeScript for miniapp frontend; Node.js for bot backend; MongoDB for channel and subscription data; Redis for caching and real-time notifications.

### Code Organization
Modular architecture separating bot logic, miniapp components, and data processing; Single responsibility principle applied to all features; Event-driven architecture for real-time updates.

### Documentation Requirements
All APIs must have OpenAPI documentation; Bot commands must have built-in help; Miniapp features must have user guides; Privacy policy and terms of service clearly documented.

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Requirements
Unit tests for all data processing functions; Integration tests for Telegram API interactions; End-to-end tests for user workflows; Performance tests for channel discovery.

### Code Quality Standards
Static analysis mandatory; Security reviews for all data handling; Performance monitoring for real-time features; User experience testing for miniapp interfaces.

### Continuous Integration
Automated testing on all changes; Staging deployment for bot testing; Monitoring for Telegram API rate limits; Alert system for service disruptions.

## Data Privacy & Compliance

### User Data Protection
User subscriptions encrypted at rest; Personal data minimal collection; Right to data deletion upon request; Audit logging for all data access.

### Channel Data Handling
Only public channel information stored; Regular data cleanup for inactive channels; Respect channel content policies; No automated scraping beyond API limits.

### Notification Ethics
Users control notification frequency; Easy unsubscribe from all notifications; No spam or excessive messaging; Content-based filtering for quality.

## Governance

### Amendment Process
Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, migration plan; All changes must be backward compatible unless explicitly marked as breaking.

### Versioning Policy
MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD format; MAJOR: Backward incompatible changes; MINOR: New features or capabilities; BUILD: Bug fixes and improvements.

### Compliance Requirements
All PRs/reviews must verify compliance; Complexity must be justified; Use runtime development guidance for specific implementation details; Violations require explicit approval and documentation.

### Review Process
Quarterly constitution reviews; Annual compliance audits; Telegram API changes monitoring; User feedback incorporation regularly.
