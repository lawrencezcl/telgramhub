# Feature Specification: Telegram Miniapp Channel Discovery

**Feature Branch**: `001-telegram-miniapp-for`
**Created**: 2025-09-30
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Telegram miniapp for channel discovery with dashboard, search, filtering capabilities and bot integration for automatic popular channel notifications based on user keyword subscriptions"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Telegram user, I want to discover popular Telegram channels that match my interests through a miniapp dashboard, so I can easily find and join relevant channels without manually searching through Telegram.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I open the Telegram miniapp, **When** I view the dashboard, **Then** I see a list of popular channels with basic information like name, description, and subscriber count.

2. **Given** I'm viewing the channel dashboard, **When** I search for channels using keywords or filters, **Then** I see relevant results that match my search criteria.

3. **Given** I've subscribed to specific keywords through the bot, **When** new popular channels match those keywords, **Then** I receive automatic notifications from the bot about these channels.

4. **Given** I find a channel I'm interested in, **When** I click on it, **Then** I can view detailed information and join the channel directly from the miniapp.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when no channels match the user's search criteria?
- How does system handle channels that become private or are deleted?
- How does system handle users who try to join channels they're already members of?
- What happens when Telegram API rate limits are reached?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a dashboard of popular Telegram channels with their basic information
- **FR-002**: Users MUST be able to search for channels using keywords and text search
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to filter channels by [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what filters should be available - category, subscriber count, language, activity level?]
- **FR-004**: System MUST track channel popularity based on [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what metrics define popularity - subscriber growth, post frequency, engagement rates?]
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to subscribe to keywords through the bot for automatic notifications
- **FR-006**: Bot MUST automatically notify users when new popular channels match their subscribed keywords
- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to join channels directly from the miniapp interface
- **FR-008**: System MUST only display publicly available channel information
- **FR-009**: Users MUST be able to manage their keyword subscriptions (add, remove, modify)
- **FR-010**: System MUST respect user notification preferences for frequency and content

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Channel**: Represents a Telegram channel with attributes like name, description, subscriber count, category, and popularity metrics
- **User**: Represents a Telegram user with their keyword subscriptions and notification preferences
- **Keyword Subscription**: Represents a user's subscription to specific keywords for channel discovery
- **Notification**: Represents automated notifications sent to users about new popular channels matching their keywords
- **Channel Category**: Represents classification of channels by topic or content type
